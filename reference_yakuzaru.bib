   abstract = {Social primates spend a significant proportion of their time exchanging grooming with their group companions. Although grooming is mainly exchanged in kind, given its hygienic and tension-reducing functions, it is still debated whether grooming also provides some social benefits, such as preferential access to resources (e.g., food or mating partners). In this study we analyzed grooming distribution among wild female Japanese macaques living in two groups on Yakushima. We tested the tendency of monkeys to reciprocate the amount of grooming received, and to direct their grooming up the hierarchy. Then we analyzed the relation of grooming to three of its possible benefits: reduced aggression, increased tolerance over food, and agonistic support against a male aggressor. The data were analyzed by means of row-wise matrix correlations. Grooming was highly reciprocated (i.e., exchanged in kind) and directed up the hierarchy in both the study groups. No significant relationship was found between grooming and aggression. Conversely, grooming favored tolerance over food, since it was positively correlated with presence on the same food patch, close proximity, and close approaches (both within 1 m) during feeding. Grooming was also positively related to agonistic support against adult males, although this relationship became nonsignificant when we controlled for kinship. Although these results are not definitive, they suggest that monkeys may derive various social benefits from grooming. This conclusion is supported by the fact that in various primate species animals tend to prefer high-ranking individuals as grooming partners.},

   abstract = {In primates, social relationships with a high frequency of social grooming are referred to as "affiliate relationships," "friendship," "bonding," and are described as involving positive emotion. However, the psychological state during social grooming has not been fully understood. In this study, I focused on blinking as a behavior that reflects psychological state during grooming in Macaca fuscata, a nonhuman wild primate, and examined for the first time whether the blink rate reflects concentration on social grooming. To test this hypothesis, I focused on ectoparasite removals during social grooming with the following three predictions: (1) blinks are synchronized with breakpoints (when monkeys can release visual attention) of mouthing ectoparasites during grooming, (2) the blink rate is lower during grooming (when requiring visual concentration) than during resting (when no visual concentration is required), and (3) the lower the blink rate during grooming (supposedly in high concentration), the higher the frequency of ectoparasites removals (outputs of the task). I recorded the faces of 10 wild female Japanese macaques on Kinkazan Island, Miyagi Prefecture, with video, while they were resting and grooming, and recorded the timing and frequency of eyeblink and ectoparasite removals. All three predictions were supported, suggesting that the blink rate during grooming can be an indicator of concentration on grooming in nonhuman primates. Whether grooming concentration is associated with an affiliative relationship with the grooming partner is an issue that should be carefully examined in future studies, but eyeblink studies may provide new perspectives for understanding the psychological state of individuals during grooming in a noninvasive manner.},

   abstract = {Recently, research has focused on the effects of the concurrence of multimodal signals and their efficacy and meaning. We observed an unreported behaviour, a ventro-ventral "rocking-embrace" gesture that is always accompanied by lip smacking as the facial expression and sometimes by a girney call, in wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) living in Kinkazan Island, northern Japan. This study examined the form and contexts of the occurrence of such multimodal signals in order to elucidate its functions. Eighty-eight cases of rocking embrace were recorded during 183 h of observation over 22 days. Adult females were involved in all of the cases. Of the 71 cases between adult females in which behaviours prior to the rocking embrace could be identified, 13 cases were allogrooming interruptions, 11 were aggression, and 42 were approaches, most of which occurred between non-kin grooming partners. The rocking embrace was often followed by allogrooming. This suggests that rocking embraces occur under stressful conditions and may function to reduce tensions. This conclusion is consistent with the contexts and functions of lip smacking and girneys shown in previous studies. In contrast with lip smacking and girneys, neither a rocking embrace nor a ventro-ventral embrace (without rocking) between anoestrous adult females has been previously shown in Japanese macaques. In other macaque species, however, the latter gesture is often observed as an affiliative behaviour that immediately follows conflict; it functions to reconcile or as a greeting when it occurs immediately after an approach. Rocking embraces among the Kinkazan macaques occur in contexts similar to, and have a similar function to, the ancestral gesture of ventro-ventral embracing (which is hidden in Japanese macaques) and the ancestral display of lip smacking (which is still observed in Japanese macaques). The ventro-ventral embrace as a tactile signal might have been hidden since it was made redundant by the visual signal of lip smacking in ancestral macaques.},

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 113, 5227-5232 (2016)] showed that in humans, pelvic sexual dimorphism is greatest around the age of highest fertility, and it becomes less marked in association with menopause in females. They proposed that this reflects changes of obstetrical versus locomotor functional demands in females. It remains unknown whether such developmental adjustment of the pelvic morphology is unique to humans. Macaques exhibit human-like cephalopelvic proportions, but they lack menopause and usually maintain fertility throughout adulthood. Here, we track pelvic development in Japanese macaques from neonate to advanced ages using computed tomography-based data. We show that female pelvic morphology changes throughout adult life, reaching the obstetrically most favorable shape at advanced ages rather than around primiparity. We hypothesize that pelvic morphology in Japanese macaques is developmentally adjusted to childbirth at advanced ages, where obstetrical risks are potentially higher than at younger ages. Our data contribute to the growing evidence that the female primate pelvis changes its morphology during the whole lifespan, possibly adjusting for changing functional demands during adulthood.},

Two adult male and 11 adult female Java (or long-tailed) monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) that were relatively unfamiliar with each other were paired 1 hour per day for five consecutive days during the periovulatory portion of the menstrual cycle. Female allogrooming was found to reduce the frequency of male displacement activities both during the course of interaction and outside it, and this decrease was proportional to the amount of allogrooming received. Female allogrooming did not, however, exert long-lasting effects on the frequency of female displacement activities. An increase in the frequency of male displacement activities was recorded during the 10-second interval immediately after the end of the female allogrooming bouts. Neither postinhibitory rebound nor frustration owing to the cessation of a pleasant situation, i.e., the two advanced explanatory hypotheses, accounted for this increase. The results of the present study concur with physiological findings that support the tension-reduction hypothesis. The social function of allogrooming appears quite important and is entirely compatible with the functional hypothesis that emphasizes hygiene.},

   abstract = {Allogrooming is considered as an altruistic behavior wherein primates exchange grooming as a tradable commodity for reciprocal grooming or other commodities such as support during aggression and tolerance during co-feeding. First, we report a case of the grooming relationships of the lowest-ranking adult female in a group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). The female (Lp) had lost a portion of the fur and was groomed by higher-ranking individuals without providing reciprocal grooming or other commodities. The groomers probably fed on lice eggs from the fur of Lp more frequently than from that of other adult groomees. This suggests that grooming-related feeding (GRF) motivated many individuals to groom Lp and influenced grooming reciprocity in dyads. Second, we investigated quantitative grooming data for adult females. A high GRF rate was found to lengthen the duration of grooming, suggesting that GRF motivates groomers to groom. From these results, we proposed 2 possible reasons for groomers' sensitivity to GRF rate: (1) the nutritional benefit from GRF compensates for part of the cost of giving grooming and facilitates giving grooming and (2) groomer's sensitivity to the GRF rate maintains the efficiency of removing lice eggs and ensures the groomee's hygienic benefit in receiving grooming.},

   abstract = {Facial features of immature individuals play a pivotal role in eliciting caretaking behaviors in humans. It has been posited that non-human animals share particular infantile facial features with humans, which can elicit caregivers' attention and caretaking behaviors. Nevertheless, the empirical examination of this hypothesis is extremely limited. In this study, we investigated infantile facial features in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), their developmental processes, and their correlation with caretaking and infant behaviors, based on 470 facial photographs from one free-ranging group. We measured the size of facial parts and evaluated these features using non-contact procedures with the animals. The results indicated that, although some partial species differences were observed, the infantile facial features in Japanese macaques were broadly consistent with those previously observed in humans and great apes. Furthermore, half of the infant subjects displayed non-linear developmental trajectories of infantile faces, similar to those suggested in humans. However, unlike previous studies in humans, infantile faces were not significantly associated with maternal or non-maternal caretaking behaviors, nor were their developmental changes correlated with infant behavioral development. These findings indicate that while many aspects of infantile facial features are shared among particular primates, humans may have evolved a uniquely elevated preference for selecting such features among the primate lineage.},

   abstract = {Human speech production obeys the same acoustic principles as vocal production in other animals but has distinctive features: A stable vocal source is filtered by rapidly changing formant frequencies. To understand speech evolution, we examined a wide range of primates, combining observations of phonation with mathematical modeling. We found that source stability relies upon simplifications in laryngeal anatomy, specifically the loss of air sacs and vocal membranes. We conclude that the evolutionary loss of vocal membranes allows human speech to mostly avoid the spontaneous nonlinear phenomena and acoustic chaos common in other primate vocalizations. This loss allows our larynx to produce stable, harmonic-rich phonation, ideally highlighting formant changes that convey most phonetic information. Paradoxically, the increased complexity of human spoken language thus followed simplification of our laryngeal anatomy.},

   abstract = {Understanding cohesion among individuals within a group is necessary to reveal the social system of group-living primates. Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) are female-philopatric primates that reside in social groups. We investigated whether individual activity and social factors can affect spatio-temporal cohesion in wild female Japanese macaques. We conducted behavioral observation on a group, which contained 38 individuals and ranged over ca. 60 ha during the study period. Two observers carried out simultaneous focal-animal sampling of adult female pairs during full-day follows using global positioning system which enabled us to quantify interindividual distances (IIDs), group members within visual range (i.e., visual unit), and separation duration beyond visual range as indicators of cohesion among individuals. We found considerable variation in spatio-temporal group cohesion. The overall mean IID was 99.9 m (range = 0-618.2 m). The percentage of IIDs within visual range was 23.1%, within auditory range was 59.8%, and beyond auditory range was 17.1%. IIDs varied with activity; they were shorter during grooming and resting, and longer during foraging and traveling. Low-ranking females showed less cohesion than high-ranking ones. Kin females stayed nearly always within audible range. The macaques were weakly cohesive with small mean visual unit size (3.15 counting only adults, 5.99 counting all individuals). Both-sex units were the most frequently observed visual unit type when they were grooming/resting. Conversely, female units were the most frequently observed visual unit type when they were foraging. The overall mean visual separation duration was 25.7 min (range = 3-513 min). Separation duration was associated with dominance rank. These results suggest that Japanese macaques regulate cohesion among individuals depending on their activity and on social relationships; they were separated to adapt food distribution and aggregated to maintain social interactions.},

   abstract = {Parturition is one of the most important yet least observed events in studies of primate life history and reproduction. Here, I report the first documented observation of a bonobo (Pan paniscus) birth event in the wild, at the Luikotale Bonobo Project field site, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The nulliparous mother's behaviour before, during and after parturition is described, along with reactions of other community members to the birth and the neonate. Data were collected through focal-animal observations, and the events postpartum were photo-documented. The behaviour and spatial distribution of party members were recorded using scan samples. Parturition occurred during the late morning in a social context, with parous females in close proximity to the parturient mother. Placentophagia occurred immediately after delivery, and the parturient shared the placenta with two of the attending females. I compare this observation with reports of parturition in captive bonobos, and highlight the observed female sociality and social support during the birth event. Plausible adaptive advantages of parturition occurring in a social context are discussed, and accrued observations of birth events in wild and free-ranging primates suggest that females may give birth within proximity of others more frequently than previously thought. This account contributes rare empirical data for examining the interface between female sociality and parturition, and the evolution of parturitional behaviours in primates.},

   abstract = {Considerable interspecific variation in female social relationships occurs in gregarious primates, particularly with regard to agonism and cooperation between females and to the quality of female relationships with males. This variation exists alongside variation in female philopatry and dispersal. Socioecological theories have tried to explain variation in female-female social relationships from an evolutionary perspective focused on ecological factors, notably predation and food distribution. According to the current ''ecological model'', predation risk forces females of most diurnal primate species to live in groups; the strength of the contest component of competition for resources within and between groups then largely determines social relationships between females. Social relationships among gregarious females are here characterized as Dispersal-Egalitarian, Resident-Nepotistic, Resident-Nepotistic-Tolerant, or Resident-Egalitarian. This ecological model has successfully explained differences in the occurrence of formal submission signals, decided dominance relationships, coalitions and female philopatry. Group size and female rank generally affect female reproduction success as the model predicts, and studies of closely related species in different ecological circumstances underscore the importance of the model. Some cases, however, can only be explained when we extend the model to incorporate the effects of infanticide risk and habitat saturation. We review evidence in support of the ecological model and test the power of alternative models that invoke between-group competition, forced female philopatry, demographic female recruitment, male interventions into female aggression, and male harassment. Not one of these models can replace the ecological model, which already encompasses the between-group competition. Currently the best model, which explains several phenomena that the ecological model does not, is a ''socioecological model'' based on the combined importance of ecological factors, habitat saturation and infanticide avoidance. We note some points of similarity and divergence with other mammalian taxa; these remain to be explored in detail.},

Affiliative approaches to infants (AAI) by group members that were accompanied with particular behaviours, such as mouthing and touching or affiliative grunts, were observed frequently. Females approached mothers with infants more frequently than did males in all age classes. Female reproductive status, parity and dominance relationships between interactants had little effect on the frequency of approaches. Mothers received more grooming and performed less grooming when they were holding their infants than when they were not. A high level of social tolerance in macaque species with relaxed dominance styles might allow the free expression of AAI. Dominance styles among females and AAI could be linked via a positive feedback relationship since AAI might play a role in relaxing the dominance style among females.},

   abstract = {Knowledge of intraspecific variation is important to test the evolutionary basis of covariation in primate social systems, yet few reports have focused on it, even in the best-studied species of the Macaca genus. We conducted a comparative study of the dominance styles among three provisioned, free-ranging groups of Japanese macaques at Shodoshima Island, Takasakiyama Mountain and Shiga Heights, and collected standard data on aggressive and affiliative behavior during a period of 5 years. Our data in the Takasakiyama and Shiga groups support previous studies showing that Japanese macaques typically have despotic social relations; nevertheless, our data in the Shodoshima group are inconsistent with the norm. The social traits of Shodoshima monkeys suggested that: (1) their dominance style is neither despotic nor tolerant but is intermediate between the two traits; (2) some measures of dominance style, e.g., frequency and duration of social interactions, covary as a set of tolerant traits in Shodoshima monkeys. This study suggests broad intraspecific variation of dominance style in Japanese macaques as can be seen in some other primate species.},

This behavior is not seen in any other populations of the species. Mean cluster sizes of two groups of Shodoshima monkeys are three and four in summer and 17 and 16 in winter, respectively. A maximum of 137 individuals have been seen to huddle in one cluster. It is difficult to explain the extra large clusters on Shodoshima only as an adaptive behavior against cold, since Shodoshima is relatively warm in the range of habitats for Japanese macaques. Compared with other groups of Japanese macaques, Shodoshima monkeys show: more frequent affinitive interactions, shorter inter-individual distance, more frequent ignoring of exclusion, more frequent aggression, less intense aggression, and more frequent counter-aggression. These characteristics suggest that the Japanese macaques on Shodoshima have relaxed dominant relations. The specific social organization of Shodoshima monkeys may sustain the formation of extra large clusters. Inter-group comparisons suggest that the social structure of Japanese macaques might be highly plastic, and that Shodoshima monkeys have less despotic, more tolerant social relations than typically reported for this species.},

The chimpanzees did not succeed in initial tests. They did not immediately understand the necessity for cooperation, and they did not adjust their behavior to work with the partner. However, the frequency of success gradually increased as the number of sessions increased and the task was varied. They began to look at the partner frequently, wait if the partner was not holding the rope, and pull the rope in synchrony with the partner. However, they did not use interactive behaviors or eye contact to synchronize their behavior. One chimpanzee was then paired with a human partner in the same situation. After initial failures, the chimpanzee began to solicit the human partner for cooperation: looking up at his face, vocalizing, and taking the partner's hand. When this chimpanzee was again paired with the chimpanzee partner, no soliciting behavior was observed. Thus, the chimpanzees could learn to coordinate their behavior through trial and error. Communicative behavior emerged during the task, but the communication differed according to the identity of the partner.},

   abstract = {Group-living animals gain fitness benefits from intergroup aggression, but also incur costs. Advertisement behaviors, such as long-distance calls and scent marking, help animals avoid disadvantageous, or less rewarding, fights. However, it remains unclear how species that lack advertisement behaviors respond to auditory information from other groups. We hypothesized that such species use auditory information prior to visual contact with the opponent group to determine its relative resource holding potential. Here, we aimed to identify the behavioral responses of Japanese macaques to simulated intergroup encounters. We conducted a vocal playback experiment and behavioral observations of 11 adult males and females from two groups intermittently from October 2015 to June 2017. In response to vocalizations of other groups, the macaques stopped feeding, decreased contact calling, and increased visual scanning, which could enable them to make timely and accurate decisions as to whether to fight or flee. The spatial cohesion of the group did not change. These results partly support our hypothesis and suggest that the onset of increased vigilance to opponents is prior to visual contact with them. The present study highlights the importance of investigating early phases of intergroup encounters in species lacking advertisement behaviors to obtain new insights on intergroup conflicts in animals.},

   abstract = {Feeding conditions, competitive regime, and female social relationships of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) on Yakushima were compared between the two habitats at two different altitudes (coniferous forest, 1,000-1,200 m and coastal forest, 0-200 m). Fruit availability was higher in the coastal forest. There was no consistent difference in the frequency of agonistic interactions within a group during feeding between the two habitats. The coastal forest evoked stronger inter-group contest competition compared to the coniferous forest as evidenced by a higher inter-group encounter rate and a higher proportion of aggressive encounters to non-aggressive ones. Birth rate was higher in larger groups compared to smaller ones in the coastal forest, but did not differ in the coniferous forest. In spite of these differences in competitive regime, no variation in female social relationships was observed, such as direction and concentration on particular individuals in grooming, linearity in dominance rank, counter-attack, and support of juvenile kin during agonistic interactions. The present results indicate that the female social relationships of Japanese macaques are robust and do not change according to changes in the current environment.},

   abstract = {{J}apanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, exhibit an annual reproductive cycle that apparently is maintained intrinsically. Translocation of nine troops to new latitudes within the northern hemisphere has had minimal effect on the timing of birth seasonality in these troops; translocation of one troop to the southern hemisphere has resulted in a 6-month forward displacement of birth seasonality in this troop. Limited available evidence indicates that, in the latitudinal zone between Toimisaki (31 degrees 22'N) and Kinkazan (38 degrees 17'N), mean birth date in in-situ troops becomes earlier as latitude of troop localities increases; the same relationship between mean birth date and latitude apparently does not apply to in-situ troops south and north of the Toimisaki-Kinkazan latitudinal zone. Within the Toimisaki-Kinkazan latitudinal zone, earlier mean birth dates at higher latitudes may permit infants to achieve an adequate level of development before the earlier onset of poor winter food conditions. South of the Toimisaki-Kinkazan latitudinal zone, winters are relatively mild and may be less of a factor in infant survival; north of this zone, poor winter food conditions persist so long that earlier infant births may be maladaptive.},

   abstract = {The {J}apanese macaques (\textit{{M}acaca fuscata yakui}) on {Y}akushima {I}sland are an endemic subspecies and are closely related to the population of Kyushu, one of the main islands of Japan. Using feces collected throughout {Y}akushima {I}sland, we examined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to investigate the phylogeography of {J}apanese macaques. Six haplotypes were observed for a 203-bp fragment of the mtDNA control region. The nucleotide diversity (pi) was low (0.0021). The genetic divergence within the {Y}akushima population was lower (0.009) than that among four haplotypes of the Kyushu population (0.015), calculated using Kimura's two-parameter method. The mismatch distribution analysis of the six haplotypes of the {Y}akushima population suggested that the {Y}akushima population had experienced a sudden expansion in population size, which could be related to the bottleneck effect. The geographic distribution of the mtDNA haplotypes was not uniform. One haplotype was distributed widely, whereas the other five haplotypes were distributed only in the lowlands. The low genetic diversity and biased distribution are discussed in relation to an environmental crash caused by ancient volcanic activity near this island, which is postulated to have happened about 7,300 years ago, and the delayed recovery of highland vegetation.},

   abstract = {Heterospecific communication signals sometimes convey relevant information for animal survival. For example, animals use or eavesdrop on heterospecific alarm calls concerning common predators. Indeed, most observations have been reported regarding anti-predator strategies. Use of heterospecific signals has rarely been observed as part of a foraging strategy. Here, I report empirical evidence, collected using playback experiments, showing that {J}apanese {S}ika deer, Cevus nippon, use heterospecific food calls of {J}apanese macaques, \textit{{M}acaca fuscata yakui}, for foraging efficiency. The deer and macaques both inhabit the wild forest of {Y}akushima {I}sland with high population densities and share many food items. Anecdotal observations suggest that deer often wait to browse fruit falls under the tree where a macaque group is foraging. Furthermore, macaques frequently produce food calls during their foraging. If deer effectively obtain fruit from the leftovers of macaques, browsing fruit fall would provide a potential benefit to the deer, and, further, deer are likely to associate macaque food calls with feeding activity. The results showed that playback of macaque food calls under trees gathered significantly more deer than silence control periods. These results suggest that deer can associate macaque food calls with foraging activities and use heterospecific calls for foraging efficiency.},

   abstract = {Group-living animals face intragroup scramble and intergroup contest competitions. Many studies have shown that larger groups bear the costs of intragroup scramble competition, which negatively affects the reproductive success of females. Unlike most primate species, {J}apanese macaques in the {Y}akushima coastal forest show increased reproductive success with group size. However, it remains unclear how group size affects the behavior of macaques. The present study examined the effects of group size on the feeding behavior of {J}apanese macaques in the {Y}akushima coastal forest. We investigated 9-13 adult females from two different-sized groups via focal animal sampling during October 2012-August 2013. We compared the feeding behavior, including patch use, between the two groups. The larger group had a larger home range and spent more time feeding, especially on mature leaves. This suggests that intragroup feeding competition should be more intense in the larger group than in the smaller group. The feeding of mature leaves might enable the larger group to increase the number of co-feeding individuals. Contrary to the predictions that the larger group travels longer distances and spends more time moving, the smaller group traveled longer distances, and spent more time moving, although the number of visited patches did not differ between the two groups. The immediate consequences of the loss of inter-group encounters could accumulate as daily travel costs, considering that group size is associated with inter-group dominance and that intergroup aggressive encounters occur frequently in the {Y}akushima coastal forest. This suggests that the smaller group has increased travel costs as a result of intergroup contest competition, which leads to decline in reproductive success. Am. J. Primatol. 77:986-1000, 2015.
